<div class="body"><p>The image to the left does not, in fact, depict a work by Banksy. For the primary reason, not many of Banksy's other works reside in New England, let alone the rest of the United States. Banksy is a UK-based artist, and an overwhelming majority of his work can be found in that country. Although there are some other international examples of Banksy works, the mathematical likeliness of Banksy creating a work of art here in the States remains though.
	<br><br>It is worth nothing, however, the accuracy of the knock-off's in regards to its Banksy-ness. Banksy's works, specifically the ones found in public on walls of busy streets such as the one pictured to the left, are best described as stencil art: grayscale, sometimes two-dimensional portraits. Compare this with other confirmed Banksy artworks, below. The art piece found on Boston's campus is of the same nature, and stands as a high-quality copycat. Additionally, the subjects of Banksy's art are sometimes randomized, having little to do with the setting in which they are found; this young paperboy is seemingly irrelevant for its home in Northeastern University's campus.</p> </div>
